# scala-lift-monster-generator

- This app was created as a way to learn Scala and Lift. 

- The app currently takes in an xp value and uses that value to generate a single monster encounter for a session of DND.
  * Default settings: Number of players = 4, Party Level = 3
  
## Further development:
  * Need to add inputs for the number of players and the party level.
  * Need to be able to generate a list of monsters based on the total amount of xp available. Currently only generates one within the given xp + modifier range.
